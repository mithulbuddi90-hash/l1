    <p>Pandas are iconic black-and-white bears from China, known for their love of bamboo, unique "thumb" for gripping it, and
    solitary nature, living in cool mountain forests, serving as a global symbol for conservation (WWF) and Chinese goodwill<br>
    (Panda Diplomacy). Despite being bears, they are mostly herbivorous, consuming vast amounts of bamboo daily due to its
    low nutrition, and use their distinct markings for camouflage and communication in their mountain habitats.</p>
